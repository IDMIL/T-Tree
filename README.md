# T-Tree
## An interactive music system developed at [IDMIL](http://www-new.idmil.org/project/t-tree/)

For more information, please check out our [Wiki](https://github.com/IDMIL/T-Tree/wiki)!

## Note
This code is for use with the T-Tree 2.0, which contains a faceplate and an external user interface.
If you are using the T-Tree 1.0, you can still use `led_osc.py` and our performance patches, but `ttree.py` will not work, as it assumes that you have a user interface available.
